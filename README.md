# hello-world
testing how to make a repository

Hi git community! 
my name is Amy and I am learning how to use git and github to version control the scripts I am creating.
This is my first readme file on github. 
Github is pretty cool.
I'm excited to learn how this works and use it properly for saving my project files. 
That's all I have to say for now...
